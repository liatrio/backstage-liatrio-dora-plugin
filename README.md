Repo for the Backstage DORA Metrics plugin

Welcome to the liatrio-dora plugin!
_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

This plugin adds the components needed to embed DORA metrics graphs into your project pages (or really any page you'd like to add it to in Backstage).

## Getting started

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
